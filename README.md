# mWatch

mWatch is a webiste that allows users to search for TV shows and add them to a watch list. Users can then view more information to see where to watch their favorite shows or add comments for everyone to view.

## Inspiration for the application
mWatch was created by two amazing developers **Michelle Mesorana** and **Ryan Goderis** who were tired of switching back and forth from an seemingly endless supply of streaming services and just simply wanted to know where to watch their favorite shows.
